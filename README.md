# ExplainIt

## Description

ExplainIt is a read-only AI-assisted tool that helps developers understand unfamiliar or legacy code before making changes.

When working with existing codebases, developers often lack clarity about why certain code exists, where it is used, and what might break if it is modified. This uncertainty leads to bugs, regressions, and wasted time.

ExplainIt addresses this problem by performing static analysis to extract structural information from the code and using AI to generate clear explanations and risk insights — without modifying or uploading the source code.
